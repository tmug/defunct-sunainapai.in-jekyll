title: "Before the US trip 2013"
---

It was mid-October 2013 when I was informed that I have to go to Reston,
VA on a business trip for 15 days. The travel dates were very near. The
first thing I needed was a visa. I was occupied on a small project that
I had taken up on my own interest and I hardly found any time to prepare
for the trip. Excitement to visit the US was in the back of my mind
while working on the project at hand was my top priority. Lo and behold
my visa appointment date coincided with my scheduled travel date. I
missed the opportunity to see the splendour of the Fall in the US. My
trip was rescheduled to December for a duration of 10 days which turned
to my advantage. I got to experience my first snow.

I had to go to Chennai for my visa appointment. It was a two day
process. After the visa was approved, I roamed a tiny bit of Chennai and
relaxed on the shores of Marina beach.

On 5 December 2013, my family dropped me at the airport and asked me to
take care of myself and have fun. My first trip overseas was about to
begin.

I boarded the plane to Dubai with Susam and Devi. Dubai is the first
country outside India, that I set my foot on. I do not know who felt
more lucky, Dubai or me &#x1f60a;. We got to spend only a couple of
hours in Dubai, to be precise Dubai airport, before our flight to the
US.  We decided to take a stroll and we found Starbucks. I was excited.
Yes, I was! There was no Starbucks at Bangalore back then. We chose
chocolate drinks over coffee considering the time of the day and the
long flight ahead of us, and regretted it soon after. It was bad and the
quantity they offer is hard to be done with. Although it was a bad
start, my further visits to Starbucks have been nice; I love their
coffee drinks. Caramel Latte is my all time favourite. The airport
looked beautiful and we clicked some pictures.

With that we boarded the plane to the US. I promised Dubai that I would
visit it in the coming years, spend more time and not just use it for
transit. It was a long flight to the the US. I slept most of it.
