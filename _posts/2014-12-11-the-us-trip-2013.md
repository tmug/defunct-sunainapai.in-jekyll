title: "The US trip 2013"
---

Our plane landed at Washington Dulles International Airport on 6
December 2013 and people in the plane started clapping. I do not know if
it is a common thing in a long flight or they did it because we landed
safely despite a lot of turbulence. After the immigration check, we were
officially in the US. It was cold outside the airport; the temperature
was 10 &deg;C as we waited at Curb 2 for our shuttle.

The pickup shuttle arrived. It took 10 minutes to reach our place of
stay, Hyatt House Herndon. We checked in to our rooms or studio suites
as they are called. We decided to rest for a while and then visit the
nearby places. However, we slept like logs and it was too late to go out
when we woke up. We ate maggie noodles for dinner at my kitchen.

We had a weekend before getting busy at the office and we had to make
the best use of it. On Saturday morning, we geared up to beat the cold.
Then we took a shuttle to Reston Town Center Transit Station, boarded a
bus to West Falls Church Metro Station and took a metro to Washington,
D.C. Once we were out of the Smithsonian Metro Station, our excitement
was brought down by the freaking cold. Inspite of being prepared, our
motor skills seemed to be crippled. It was difficult for us to talk. I
felt immense pain in my toes. Instead of reading the maps, I observed
the people around and kept wondering what American skin is made of! I
guess it takes a while to get accustomed to such extreme cold and to be
watching weather report each morning to plan the day ahead, not just to
bring it up in small talks. &#x1f60f;

After a while we were up for exploring the National Mall. Here
are some of the pictures we shot along the way.

On Saturday evening, my uncle, Raju Mama as I call him, and cousin,
Tanya, came over from Michigan. They were to show us around the next
day. On Sunday morning, Tanya looked over the window and announced snow
flurry. I felt joyous and hurried to witness my first snow. It was
beautiful. &#x1f60a; I called up Susam and Devi, and asked them to look
outside.

We had a quick breakfast at the Hyatt and headed to Washington, D.C.,
this time by road. It was warm and comfortable inside the car, not to
forget how safe we felt on the road even as my uncle drove at around 100
kmph. We kept noticing everything that was around us&mdash;the snow, salt
trucks, automated toll machines, interstate highways, traffic signals
hanging above every lane, railway lines. Subconsciously, I was comparing
all this to Bangalore and I felt how sparsely populated and well
organized this part of the US is. We reached the National Mall. We
jogged to a few museums and monuments that we had not visited the
previous day.

We thoroughly enjoyed [Hubble 3D][1] at the Lockheed Martin IMAX Theater
at the National Air and Space Museum. &#x1f60a; Then we headed to the
Tysons Corner Center and Best Buy, did some shopping and called it a day.

On Monday morning we headed to office. We took the shared shuttle
provided by the hotel. Needless to say Americans are punctual and
respect each other&rsquo;s time. We observed and learnt tipping
etiquette. It took a while for us to actually start tipping. People in
our shuttle got dropped off at their offices. We got down at ours.
Unlike Bangalore office, bags did not go through security check and
there were no security guards at the entrance. The cubicles were really
tall. There was a kitchen on each floor. Along with coffee machines,
there were a variety of soft drinks and beer bottles in the
refrigerators. I did not catch sight of anyone browsing the web,
checking personal email or spending time on social networking sites
during the working hours. They all seemed deeply engrossed in work.

For the rest of the week we were at office from 9 AM to 5 PM. We spent
the remaining time seeing around. We frequently visited the Reston Town
Center, which was nearby, Best Buy, Target and Kohl&rsquo;s. We ate; we
roamed; we shopped; &#x1f60a; disliked Walmart; window shopped at the
Dulles Town Center.

The weekend arrived and we headed to the Tysons Corner Center. We shopped for
nine hours straight; it was the first time for Susam. We were so busy with
shopping that we lost two taxis we had booked to return to our hotel.
Both taxis had arrived one after another and went back when they did not
find us outside.

We shopped till we were asked to go out when the mall closed. There we
were, the three of us, in the freezing night, with a flight to catch the
next morning and no way to go back to the hotel. There was silence
everywhere, not a single person around and we were already discussing
how not to get mugged. No taxi service picked up our calls, probably
because it was 11:30 PM and the weather was bad. We called up the hotel
and they somehow managed to send us a taxi. We made it to our rooms and
began packing. The next morning, we said good bye to the US, flew over
the North Atlantic ocean to return home.
