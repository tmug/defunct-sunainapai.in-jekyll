In July 2015, we went on a trip to Malaysia for 10 days. The plan was to
stay 3 nights each at Kuala Lumpur, Penang Island and Rebak Island, and
visit Langkawi Island as well. A fortnight before the trip, I made a
list of places to visit and Susam printed the maps with the places
located. We had a fair idea of our itinerary in Malaysia. We got
Malaysian Visa, bought Malaysian Ringgit and Matrix SIM cards with data
plan, booked flights and hotels, and packed our bags. The planning part
was fun and the best was yet to come. &#x1f60a;

Our trip started with a flight to Kuala Lumpur. We landed early morning
and took a taxi to our hotel. We stayed at [Arenaa Star Hotel][ASH],
*Jalan Hang Lekiu*. Most places to visit in Kuala Lumpur are walkable
from this hotel.

In the evening, we took KTM Komuter from Bank Negara which was about 20
minutes walk from our hotel to Batu Caves. Batu Caves is about 13
kilometres from the city. KTM Komuter is the most convenient way to
reach there from any KTM Komuter station in Kuala Lumpur.

Batu Caves is a limestone hill with a series of caves and cave temples.
There is a statue of Lord Murugan at the foot of the caves.

    42.7 meters (140 feet) tall; It is the tallest statue of Hindu deity
    in Malaysia and the second tallest statue of Hindu deity in the
    world.</figcaption>
</figure>

We had to climb up a steep flight of 272 steps. We were a little
hesitant because of the violent and fearless monkeys troubling people.
However, the cave was too interesting to skip and the limestone forming
the caves is said to be 400 million years old. We reached the top
entrance along with a few other people who had also made up their mind
to get to the top. On the way up, some people got the courage to film
the monkeys while I got the motivation to do cardio after I would get
back to Bangalore. &#x1f60f; We spent some time at the caves.

After returning from Batu Caves we went to Petaling Street *(Jalan
Petaling)* which is located in China Town. It is infamous for pirated
clothes and accessories, and bootleg DVDs and CDs.

    <figcaption>Petaling street, China Town; it is infamous for pirated

</figure>

Petaling street also has food joints that serve Malay, Thai and Chinese
cuisines. We had a refreshing drink served as *sejuk* (cold) and *panas*
(hot). We saw the fruit they use to make the drink but we did not know
what it was called. I later learnt that the fruit is [luohan guo][LG]
and the drink also has [longan][L]. The drink made us visit Petaling
street again on our last day at Kuala Lumpur.

On Day 2, we walked to Kuala Lumpur Tower *(Menara Kuala Lumpur)*.

<figure id="one-up">
     <a href="{{site.url}}/img/kuala-lumpur-trip-2015/kuala-lumpur-tower.jpg"

    <figcaption>Kuala Lumpur Tower; The tower is used for communication
    purposes and features an antenna that reaches 421 metres (1381 feet)
    above ground level.</figcaption>
</figure>

Once inside the tower we got a reservation for a window side table at
[Atmosphere 360](http://www.atmosphere360.com.my/), a revolving
restaurant. It is situated 282 meters (948 feet) above the ground level. In
the elevator to the restaurant we could feel the change in air pressure
in our ears due to the rapid change of altitude as the elevator climbed.

The dining at [Atmosphere 360](http://www.atmosphere360.com.my/) is an
experience not to be missed if one visits Kuala Lumpur. The dining area
completes one revolution in about two hours. In these two hours, it
provides a 360&deg; panaromic view of the city. It is designed to give
spaceship-like atmosphere in the night but this is something we could
not experience since we went in the afternoon. In the afternoon the
crystal clear view of the city is marvellous.

In the same tower, we also visited an observation deck which is situated
276 metres (928 feet) above ground level and an Aquarium located at the
foot of tower.

We then headed to Petronas Twin Towers *(Menara Petronas)* which is
located about a kilometre away from the Kuala Lumpur Tower. The front
view of the towers is majestic. As the saying goes&mdash;A picture is
worth a thousand words; we tried our best to capture the tall beauty.
&#x1f60a;

We bought passes to the Skybridge which is located at the 41st floor of
Petronas Twin Towers and to the 86th floor, both of which are open for
visitors during certain times of the day only. Depending on the time of
the year, one could get the passes [online][ETICKET] in advance or hit
the long queue early in the morning on the day of visit or get the
passes just in time like we did.

We spent some time at Suria KLCC mall. We roamed in and around the
towers to our satisfaction. Just when we were about to leave we caught
sight of the musical fountain show at the Simfoni Lake and thoroughly
enjoyed the show in the cool and misty breeze.

We took a bus to *Bukit Bintang* and walked to *Jalan Alor*. Jalan Alor
is a street dedicated entirely to cheap hawker food of mainly Malay,
Thai and Chinese cuisines. Food is served in open-air, with chairs and
tables placed along the entire street. One can glance the menus while
walking till the end of the street and pick a place to eat. We had a
delicious dinner at this place. To this day, my mouth waters at the
thought of the salted fish bits in the Thai fried rice.

It was 11 PM; it was time to head back to the hotel which is 20 minutes
away from Jalan Alor. We began walking back but our printed map lead us
to a dead end. Data plan was not yet activated on our phones. We figured
an alternate route which led us to *Changkat Bukit Bintang*, a street
full of massage places, pubs and restaurants that serve Western food. My
legs had called it a night already, and we were in this lively place.
We got a relaxing feet massage for an hour after which we walked to our
hotel.

On Day 3, it was a long walk to Kuala Lumpur Bird Park. On the way we
saw Merdeka Square *(Dataran Merdeka)* which literally means
Independence Square. We also saw Sultan Abdul Samad Building *(Bangunan
Sultan Abdul Samad)*.

We took a ride on the hop on hop off bus from Kuala Lumpur Bird Park to
Aquaria KLCC.

Aquaria KLCC is an oceanarium located beneath Kuala Lumpur Convention
Centre (KLCC). We saw a myriad of sea creatures. Underwater tunnel felt
mesmerizing.

We then headed to Pavilion Mall and then to Jalan Alor. There was live
music at most of the open-air restaurants in Jalan Alor. We walked along
the street to reach a vendor selling coconut ice cream. The ice cream is
made of coconut milk. We had the ice cream with minimal toppings. The
flavour reminded me of eating grated coconut with sugar in my childhood
days. After spending some time here, we walked to Petaling street of
China Town. With this our stay at Kuala Lumpur was coming to an end.
Next morning, we left to Penang with a wish to visit Kuala Lumpur again
sometime.
